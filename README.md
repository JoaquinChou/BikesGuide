For the 2018 National Internet of Things Design Competition，i.e. TI Cup.This project uses hardware indicators to solve the problem of users navigating while riding. The project includes the software side and the hardware side. The deflection angle at the next moment of riding is calculated by the software side and transmitted to the hardware side via Bluetooth, and the pointer of the hardware side is indicated by the angle.
The activities that have been implemented are
1. Use the AMap API to implemented the location, cycling path planning, navigation，POI search and recording history data.
